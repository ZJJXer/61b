All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:我设计resize()等一系列函数时，并没有将所有代码都写在一个函数中，而是分开编写，不同条件进行不同的操作，并且抓住了capacity这一关键属性，各个函数功能明确而不显得冗杂。

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:代码中有几处使用到了循环语句，即对deque有值范围的遍历，我觉得可以提取出一个函数来实现这个功能。

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A:我认为这个类的实现细节在于要双向考虑deque，之前只写一个方向，在Visualizer中发现问题，并及时改正。

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:我认为get方法的递归版本并不巧妙，虽然实现了功能，但设计方面比较笨拙，核心思想仍是迭代。
